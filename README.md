## Climatic
Monorepo project that shows the current weather data and weather forecast for next 7 days. <br />
Created from scratch to participate in a 14-days hackathon hosted by [midudev](https://www.github.com/midudev).

## Hackathon
- The hackathon goal was build a weather web app (*mobile-first* or *mobile-only*) in two weeks using a weather API from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com).
- It was announced in this [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1488279878) at **2022/05/19**.
- There was 38 project entries. The first 19 were reviewed at **2022/06/02** in this [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1315914232).
- Climatic was picked as the 4th best project in the first review, but was not elegible for any prize.
- The last commit before the project revision can be found [here](https://github.com/marsidev/climatic/tree/5d42530432663b8d30fe57047ee51e742d508851).
