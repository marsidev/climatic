## ‚ú® Getting Started

### Clone the project using one of these ways:
1. [Fork](https://github.com/marsidev/climatic/fork) the repository

2. Clone the repository locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/marsidev/climatic
cd climatic
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Set environment variables
Create an `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following values:
```bash
RAPIDAPI_KEY=
APP_URL=
```

> To get your `RAPIDAPI_KEY` you need to subscribe to [weatherapi](https://rapidapi.com/weatherapi/api/weatherapi-com/). <br />
`APP_URL` is optional. If present, will be used as origin url for [cors](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-cors).

### Run the project
```bash
pnpm dev
```

In order to use the geolocation API, you need to run the client server with `https` protocol. This can achieved by running:
```bash
pnpm dev:https
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

> If you are running in *https* mode, you will get a warning in your browser about non-secure connection.
